A System That Remembers

---

Chapter 1 — The Fire That Stays

---

# Slower Than I Planned

I was behind this morning —  
more than I wanted to be.

But for a moment, I slowed down.  
And that’s when I remembered a story.

---

# A Talk That Stayed With Me

It was a speech Steve Jobs gave in 2005.  
He had been fired from Apple.  
He said it was the best thing that could’ve happened.

Not because it felt good — but because it reset everything.

---

# Let’s Watch 3 Minutes Together

[Steve Jobs — Stanford, 2005](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc?si=_PGUJw45cHJpVgId&t=338)

Just a short clip.  
I’ll explain why afterward.

---

# Why I Brought That In

Because the most lasting systems  
don’t start with a document or a deck.

They start with a pause.  
And a decision not to settle.

---

# This Talk Is a Reset

Not of our tech.  
Not of our roles.

Just a quiet reset —  
of how we think about what already works.

---

# Pixar. Apple. Us.

Mike when I shared this framework
said it reminded him of Pixar —  
not in brand, but in principle.

A place where values guide the system,  
and structure makes space for creativity.

---

# Remember Before Linters?

Before formatting tools, everything was friction.  
Tabs. Spacing. Confusion.

We didn’t fix that because someone made us.  
We fixed it because we cared about the work.

This framework is the same —  
but instead of formatting code,  
it helps us format alignment.

---

# Not a Corporate Rollout

This isn’t some new process we’re required to follow.  
There’s no mandate. No performance attached.

It’s just a reflection:  
Let’s name what’s already good — and build from there.

---

Chapter 2 — We Are the A-Team

---

# A Quiet Truth

I’ve been here over 10 years.  
Long enough to see faces come and go.  
Friends. Mentors. People I still miss.

But also long enough to know:  
we’ve never stopped being capable of great things.

---

# Recognition Matters

Over 3 million people go to bed every night hungry.  
But 4 billion go to bed hungry  
for a simple word of encouragement.

We don’t always need more resources.  
We just need to be seen.

---

# You’re Already Enough

Austin told me something recently —  
that he’s more confident in _this group_  
than ever before.

Not because we’re perfect.  
But because we care,  
and we keep showing up.

That’s what makes us different.

---

# Builders, Not Just Engineers

I see people in this org  
who’ve stepped up again and again —  
who see the bigger picture,  
ask the harder questions,  
and stay when it’s not easy.

That’s not just skill.  
That’s heart.

---

# Transparency at the Top

Think about our leadership —  
especially Ryan and Austin.

It’s rare to feel transparency that real.  
To know you can actually reach out  
and _be heard_.

That matters more than any system we design.

---

# A Conversation I Needed

Two weeks ago, I sat down with Austin.  
What I thought would be 30 minutes  
turned into almost two hours.

I finally asked for that meeting —  
not because something was broken,  
but because I needed to know where we were heading.

---

# After Alan

When we lost Alan,  
I felt a drift.

Not just in structure — but in meaning.  
I started to wonder:  
were we still who I thought we were?

And honestly, I didn’t know.

---

# What I Found

That meeting reminded me:  
our leadership isn’t distant.

They’re _in it_ with us.  
They feel the same shifts.  
The same weight.  
The same hope.

I was just late in realizing it.

---

# A New Kind of Team

We’re moving from fixed squads  
to more dynamic teams.

You might be a backend dev  
building a small FE feature  
with a designer and a PM —  
not because it’s perfect,  
but because it’s _possible_ now.

That’s not chaos. That’s trust.

---

# The A-Team

So if no one’s said it lately,  
I’ll say it now:

You’re not here by accident.  
You’re the A-Team.

And this moment — this reset —  
only works because it starts with you.

---

Chapter 3 — A Framework That Feels Like Home

---

# 100 Hours Later

Over the last few weeks,  
I’ve put about 100 hours into this.

Not because I was asked to.  
Because I wanted to understand  
what kind of system could _scale trust_, not just tasks.

---

# This Is Not Mine

I want to be clear about something:

This isn’t my system.  
It’s ours.

I might have written it down —  
but it only works if we all believe in it  
enough to help shape it.

---

# Not a Demo. A Reflection.

You’re not getting a walkthrough today.  
Not a checklist. Not a tour of the files.

What I want to share  
isn’t a process.

It’s a way of thinking.

---

# Just Sit With It

All I ask is that you let this sit with you.  
Over the weekend. No action. No pressure.

I’ll follow up Monday with more details.  
We’ll have our first official sync next Friday.

But today — just feel the shape of it.

---

# Why Mike's Comment Landed

Mike once said  
this felt like something Pixar or Apple might do.

Not because it looked fancy —  
but because it lifted values to the org level.

That’s all I’m trying to do here.  
Not make something new.  
Just name what’s already true.

---

# A Language That Holds Us

I believe good systems don’t just guide work —  
they guide _us_.

They give us a language  
that helps us stay aligned  
even when we’re moving fast  
or across different domains.

That’s what this framework is meant to do.

---

# Pillars, Not Control

At the heart of the framework  
are three pillars.

They’re not rules. They’re not org charts.  
They’re reminders —  
of how we work when we’re at our best.

---

# The Engineering System Framework

We call it the **Engineering System Framework** — or ESF.  
Three pillars, one purpose:

To make our values visible.  
To create space for ownership.  
To help us build together — with less friction.

That’s what this is about.

---

Chapter 4 — Pillars and Presence

---

# Three Pillars

The framework is built around three simple pillars.

Each one represents  
how we build, how we scale,  
and how we grow — together.

---

![Image of the pillars](./pillars.png)

---

# Architecture & Systems

> “We design for security, scalability, and simplicity — not trends.”

This is the foundation — the long game.  
Clarity. Health. Tradeoffs. Thoughtfulness.

I’ll be helping lead this pillar moving forward.

---

# Framework & Cadence

> “We scale through rhythm, ownership, and principle — this is our process.”

This is how we keep momentum without burnout.  
Reviews, rituals, culture, and evolution.

Sjon embodies this better than anyone I know.  
He understands structure — and leads it with empathy.

---

# Chapters & Communication

> “We grow through shared learning, clarity, and visibility — not performance.”

This is the heartbeat.  
Not just how we grow skills — but how we stay connected.

To me, David reflects this deeply.  
Across AI, data, onboarding, and mentorship —  
he’s always cared about the human layer.

---

# Leadership Without Titles

These pillars don’t create new roles.  
They reflect presence — not power.

We already have these people.  
We’re just honoring how they hold the system.

---

# This Is Not a Hierarchy

It’s not about control.  
It’s not about who signs off.

It’s about shared awareness.  
About knowing who you can lean on  
when you’re building something that matters.

---

# The Council Starts Here

The pillars are supported by a council —  
made up of domain architects and contributors  
who care about long-term systems.

You’re not just invited.  
You’re already part of it.

---

Chapter 5 — The Long Game of Architecture

---

# One Doc

When I stepped into the frontend architect role,  
I was handed a single document.

A few todos.  
No system. No structure. Just space.

---

# That Space Was a Gift

It could’ve felt like absence.  
But it turned into something else.

A question:  
_If someone stood here after me… what would I want them to have?_

---

# It Started With a Council

The first thing I created was the FE Council.  
Not as a status group — but as a foundation.

The idea was simple:  
If we're building the system,  
we should build it _together_.

---

# Equal Footing

Council members aren’t under me.  
We’re on equal footing.

If someone brings up a need — like visibility or alerting —  
we don’t just log it. We _move_.

That’s what makes it sacred.  
We listen. We respond. We own.

---

# Not About Control

Architecture isn’t about locking things down.  
It’s about keeping the system _healthy_.

Stable. Understandable. Sharable.  
We lead through sandboxes, not mandates.

---

# Standardization That Feels Like Home

If you work on Travelpass or Nitecrawler or Cable,  
it should _feel_ familiar.

That doesn’t mean uniformity —  
it means comfort. Ease. Shared scaffolding.

---

# Scalability ≠ Shiny

Not every new tool scales.  
Some trends burn out fast.

We look for what improves velocity _and_ clarity.  
Sometimes that’s Vitest.  
Sometimes it’s just one well-placed README.

We test in isolation.  
We measure before migrating.

---

# Living Documentation

We treat documentation like code.  
Not as an afterthought — but as part of the rhythm.

Update it as part of your PR.  
Keep it visible. Keep it light.  
Truth shouldn’t decay.

---

# The Role of the Architect

Not to control.

But to protect clarity.  
To reduce friction.  
To hold the long game —  
so others can build freely, without guessing.

---

Chapter 6 — Cadence as Culture

---

# The Rhythm Layer

If architecture holds the foundation,  
then cadence holds the flow.

This is how we move together —  
across time, across teams, across change.

---

# The Pillar

> “We scale through rhythm, ownership, and principle — this is our process.”

It’s not about more meetings.  
It’s about _shared momentum_  
that doesn’t burn us out.

---

# What Sjon Brings

Sjon leads with systems.  
But never at the cost of empathy.

He doesn’t just build process.  
He builds _trust_ in the process.

That’s why this pillar feels like his to lead.

---

# Fundamentals, Not Bureaucracy

This is the layer that holds:

- Principles & Direction
- Review Cadence
- Health checks
- Initiative ownership
- Migration logs

Not as paperwork. As rhythm.

---

# Rhythm Over Routine

Quarterly reviews.  
Lightweight initiative tracking.  
Ownership clarity without micromanagement.

The goal isn’t to manage people —  
it’s to make _good decisions repeatable_.

---

# Health Is a Habit

We don’t wait for systems to break.  
We build in upkeep from the start.

That means:

- Checking dependencies quarterly
- Reviewing docs as we code
- Auditing drift _before_ it hurts us

---

# The Role of Rhythm

It’s not just efficiency.  
It’s resilience.

When things go sideways —  
rhythm helps us realign  
without starting from scratch.

---

# Cadence Is Culture

Process done well isn’t a tax.  
It’s a support beam.

It lets us build, scale, and evolve  
without losing ourselves in the work.

That’s what this pillar is for.

---

Chapter 7 — Chapters That Speak

---

# The Human Layer

Not everything we build is in code.  
Some of it is in conversations.  
In visibility. In mentorship.  
In the way we show up for each other.

---

# The Pillar

> “We grow through shared learning, clarity, and visibility — not performance.”

This is the heart of the system.  
The part that reminds us we’re more than output.

---

# Why David

If you’ve worked with David Webb,  
you know he carries this pillar naturally.

He doesn’t just run data or AI.  
He builds environments where learning _feels possible_.

Training materials. Cross-domain mentorship.  
Thoughtful onboarding.

Always steady. Always human.

---

# What Chapters Hold

This pillar is where we hold:

- Chapter meetings
- Lightning talks
- Mini trainings
- Contribution logs
- Slack discussion culture

It’s not fluff. It’s **visibility with purpose**.

---

# Talk Rhythm

Every engineer gives two talks a year:  
One lightning talk — short, story-driven, high impact.  
One mini training — lean, no pressure, slides optional.

It’s not about performance.  
It’s about sharing what you know best.

---

# Slack Is Part of the System

Conversations don’t only happen in meetings.  
Slack is a living system —  
a place for open threads, questions, and learning in motion.

No ceremony. Just connection.

---

# Leadership Joins the Rhythm

Our leadership rotation includes:

- Mike on product direction (Q1/Q3)
- Ryan on vision (Q1/Q3)
- Austin on priorities (Q2/Q4)
- Angela on brand/growth (Q2/Q4)
- Sjon on technical strategy (Q2/Q4)

One talk per quarter.  
No walls between builders and leaders.

---

# Culture Is a System Too

We don’t track culture for show.  
We build it into our rhythm.

Because growth isn’t just what you learn —  
it’s what you _share_.

That’s what keeps a system alive.

---

## Chapter 8 — Toward the Council

# From Pillars to Presence

These pillars aren’t ideas on paper.  
They’re already alive in the people around you.

We’re not introducing something new.  
We’re recognizing what’s already been carrying the system.

---

# No New Roles. No Reshuffling.

This isn’t about promotion.  
It’s not about titles.  
No one’s being reassigned.

It’s about presence —  
naming who’s already doing the work  
so we can support each other more clearly.

---

# The Council Is Real

The framework is supported by a council —  
domain architects, contributors, and leads  
across FE, BE, Data, Mobile, AI, Platform, Security.

Not a top-down body.  
Just a consistent thread through change.

---

# Domain Councils

Each domain shapes its own future.

The FE Council started this idea.  
Now we’re formalizing it across domains —  
with roundtable updates and shared rhythm.

It scales. It adapts.  
And it gives every area a voice in how we grow.

---

# You’re Already Part of This

If you’ve ever given a talk,  
joined a sync,  
offered feedback,  
or asked a hard question —

You’ve already been part of the system.  
This just names it,  
so we can build with more intention.

---

# No Hierarchies. Just Alignment.

The council doesn’t sit above.  
It sits _with_.

A space to see across systems.  
To catch what’s falling through.  
To keep things moving when complexity creeps in.

That’s what it’s for.

---

# The Invitation

You don’t need to opt in.  
You’re not signing onto anything today.

Just… feel it.

We’ll share more on Monday.  
And next Friday, we begin — together.

---

## Chapter 9 — The Principle Behind the Word

# Not the Final Slide

This isn’t a conclusion.  
It’s a return to something quieter.

Beneath all the structure —  
what really matters is the principle behind the word.

---

# Hyrum Smith and the 7 Habits

Years ago, Hyrum Smith —  
one of Stephen Covey’s early collaborators —  
created something called the Reality Model.

It looked different than the 7 Habits.  
But it was grounded in the same truth.

---

![Comparison](./frameworks.png)

---

# Principle Over Form

He used to say:

> “You can rename gravity. But it’ll still pull you down.”

In other words —  
the _principle_ holds, no matter the phrasing.

You can color it. Reword it.  
But truth doesn’t change with packaging.

---

# The Same Is True Here

You don’t have to call it the Engineering System Framework.  
You don’t have to remember every pillar today.

But what it’s built on —  
clarity, trust, rhythm, presence —  
those things already live in the way we work.

---

# What Happens Now

You don’t need to do anything yet.  
This weekend, just think about it.

Ask yourself what you want this system to hold.  
What you want to protect.  
What you want to share.

I’ll follow up Monday.  
We’ll meet again next Friday.

---

# The Quiet Ask

No hype. No slides to memorize.  
Just a system shaped by who we already are.

Thank you for holding space for this.  
Let’s keep building — from the inside out.

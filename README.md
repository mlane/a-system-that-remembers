# A System That Remembers

A quiet introduction to the [Engineering System Framework](https://github.com/mlane/engineering-system-framework) — not a rollout, but a reflection.

This presentation was written for engineering leadership, architects, and domain contributors. It is not a walkthrough or strategy doc.  
It’s a naming ceremony — a story-driven talk designed to invite alignment, not enforce change.

> This system isn’t new. It’s already alive in the way we work.  
> The presentation simply gives it language — and space to grow.

## Purpose

This repository holds the original Slidev presentation behind the ESF.  
It was written and presented in October 2025 by Marcus Lane, as part of the system’s internal introduction.

The talk is organized as a minimalist, spoken narrative — broken into chapters:

- Chapter 1: The Fire That Stays
- Chapter 2: We Are the A-Team
- Chapter 3: A Framework That Feels Like Home
- Chapter 4: Pillars and Presence
- Chapter 5: The Long Game of Architecture
- Chapter 6: Cadence as Culture
- Chapter 7: Chapters That Speak
- Chapter 8: Toward the Council
- Chapter 9: The Principle Behind the Word

Each chapter holds one core idea.  
The full deck can be run locally using Slidev.
